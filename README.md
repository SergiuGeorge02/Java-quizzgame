Developed a Java trivia game featuring a user-friendly graphical interface built with JavaFX. Implemented login functionality for user access. It maintains a history of players and their scores, with data stored in a database for seamless retrieval and updating.
In order to do the user interface I used JavaFX with scene builder. This was the only thing used to do the GUI of the application.
To store the questions of the game I used a text file where all questions where stored. In another text file the correct answers were stored. I also used a text file in which other proposed answers for each questions were stored.
The game also had a database because each user had to login or make an account in order to be able to play the game. In order to maintain that database I used JDBC and MYSQL to set up the database.
